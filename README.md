# rc stands for run commands.

In the context of Unix-like systems, the term rc stands for the phrase "run commands". It is used for any file that contains startup information for a command.

From Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

> There was a facility that would execute a bunch of commands stored in a file; it was called runcom for "run commands", and the file began to be called "a runcom". rc in Unix is a fossil from that usage.

this repo is an attempt to create a unified solution for myself.
I got plenty of dotfiles repositories and all are contantly changing depending on needs, machines, os:es.

Sometimes i try some solution and like it on other occasion i remove something from one machine and leave it on another.

So here i can collect my rc-files from all the machines i use and see what persists
